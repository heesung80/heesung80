### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a 2nd-year postdoctoral researcher at the Wulff Lab in the pharmacology department at the University of California, Davis. My primary project at UC Davis is to identify novel lead compounds using virtual screening and to construct homology models to understand the molecular mechanism of action. Also, I am collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on a machine learning project for pose classification of 3D complex structures using deep convolutional neural networks.
