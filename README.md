### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where my primary focus is on a machine learning project involving the classification of poses for 3D complex structures using deep convolutional neural networks. Additionally, I am engaged in a collaborative effort with the Wulff Lab at UC Davis, where we are working on identifying novel lead compounds through virtual screening and developing homology models to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of action.
